# LLM Optimizations

This chapter covers an array of optimization techniques that are frequently used in LLMs; mostly for serving. Some of these techniques can be applied to other types of models. We subdivide the techniques into two sub-parts: `Quality Neutral` and `Quality Detrimental`. `Quality Neutral` techniques improve latency or throughput without deteriorating the quality of the output while `Quality Detrimental` techniques have a negative impact on the quality of the model; they offer a tradeoff between latency and quality.
