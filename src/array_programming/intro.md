# Array Programming Fundamentals

This chapter introduces array programming fundamentals using `NumPy`. While modern deep learning often happens in frameworks like PyTorch or JAX, `NumPy` remains the lingua franca of the Python data ecosystem. Crucially, the `NumPy` API provides the conceptual foundation for the tensor operations used in `PyTorch` and is adopted directly by `JAX` (`jax.numpy`). By mastering `NumPy`, you are learning not just a library, but the mental model required to manipulate high-dimensional data and understand the vectorized operations that drive ML performance.
