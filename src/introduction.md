# Introduction

I am writing this book to compile the knowledge I acquired bit by bit while working on Gemini at Google Deepmind. I want it to cover most of the skills required to work as a Performance Engineer in modern ML labs.

## Prerequisites

A good understanding of computer programming is required. Linear algebra, Machine Learning, and distributed programming skills will greatly help understanding the material but are not necessary.
