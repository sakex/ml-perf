# Introduction

This book's goal is to compile the skills required to succeed at the Machine Learning Performance Engineer interview. It should be used as interview preparation.

## Prerequisites

A good understanding of computer programming is required. Linear algebra, Machine Learning, and distributed programming skills will greatly help understanding the material but are not necessary.

## Structure

Some chapters will be marked with a `(theory)` tag. This indicates that they introduce concepts that are required to fully understand questions asked during interviews, even though they are not strictly required to succeed.
