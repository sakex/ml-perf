# All-Gather

An All-Gather operation takes an array with an axis distributed over multiple chips, and exchanges the data from each chip to each other chip such that each chip ends up with a full view of the data. It basically "unshards" one or several axes.

For instance, a vector of length `256` whose single axis would be sharded over 4 devices:

Each chip initially holds 64 different elements. After the All-Gather, they all have a replicated view of the same 256 elements.
